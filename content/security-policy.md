# Hey there, security friend! 👋

I'm running this tech blog as a personal space to share my thoughts and experiences. While it's not a big corporate site, I still care about keeping things secure!

## Found something wonky?

If you've spotted a security issue, that's super helpful! Here's what you can do:

1. Keep it between us for now - please don't post it publicly 🤫
2. Drop me a line at security@mizu.reisen
3. Give me about 48 hours to get back to you
4. We can work together to fix it!

## What helps me most in a report

- What did you find?
- How can I see it myself?
- What could go wrong if left unfixed?
- Got ideas for fixing it? I'm all ears!

## Just so you know...

This is a personal blog, so I'm not really worried about:
- Results from automated scanners
- Social engineering attempts
- DOS attacks
- Issues with other sites I don't run

Thanks for looking out for my blog's security! 🙏
