Greetings,

I can go by Hoang, or if you'd like to get familiar, Mizu or Reisen work too.

My professional focus areas include security, compliance and technical consulting.

As part of a small organization, I have a lot on my table and I'm working on it so don't mind about it.

Outside of my core responsibilities, I'm personally interested in embedded and operating systems.
