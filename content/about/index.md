Greetings,

I can go by Hoang, or if you'd like to get familiar, Mizu or Reisen work too.

Currently I'm working mainly in security and compliance. Sometime I do join some technical consulting projects.

Don't mind i'm having a lot of on my table. My organization is relatively small so I have a lot to cover.

Beside these, I'm also very interested about embedded stuffs and operating systems.
