# Hi there,

I can go by Hoang, or if you'd like to get familiar, Mizu or Reisen work too.

I'm passionate about delivering expertise in **security**, **compliance**, and **technical consulting**.

As part of a small organization, I have a lot on my table and I'm working on it so don't mind about it.

Beside delivering secure and compliant environments. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn from clients through technical consulting, gaining insights into different security approaches and use cases.

When I'm not busy with my core responsibilities, you'll find me exploring the world of embedded systems and operating systems.
