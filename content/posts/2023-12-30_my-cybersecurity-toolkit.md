## Overview

Ever since I started my journey into the world of cybersecurity, I've been compiling a list of resources and tools. It's my way of keeping track of everything I'm learning and organizing it in a way that makes sense to me. Think of it as my personal cybersecurity knowledge base.

The core principle I use is categorization by team and purpose. This means I first group tools and resources based on who primarily uses them (Red Team, Blue Team, or other security functions) and then, within those groups, I further organize them by what they are used for (vulnerability scanning, incident response, etc.).

This will be updated over time as I find new resources and tools.
