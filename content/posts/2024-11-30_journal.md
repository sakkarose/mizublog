Here we are, with the last month of the year already upon us. I'm not sure why I'm feeling so heavy-hearted, maybe it's because I've already shifted into survival mode this December, knowing I have a lot on my plate for 2024. 

I should give myself credit for surviving November, but that feeling is diminished because I made zero progress on my LPI certificate and my Python automation course. 

It's tough seeing other people wrapping up their year successfully while I'm struggling. 

Still, I'm going to give myself some breathing room for the next two weeks and then try to settle as many things as possible. 

Regarding film, I watched "The Substance (2024)" twice with my friends. It was really good, holding my attention while simultaneously making me feel nervous with its sound and screen effect designs. You should try it if you have a chance.

About my favorite song this month, I really love me some Jazz Fusion with my late night works.
