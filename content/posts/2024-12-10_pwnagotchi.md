On the first part of building and running a pwnagotchi, I will detail about picking the hardware pieces in this part since there are a lot of different builds you can do for pwnagotchi.

The main purpose is to build a pwnagotchi that fits your need. For example if you're going outside a lot, you're gonna need a separated power bank because Raspberry Pi 0 compatible UPS will not be able to charge your pwnagotchi for several hours. Another example can be that you're going to public places a lot which means you will need a low profile pwnagotchi build.

Here comes a checklist for pwnagotchi hardware.

1. Compute: Raspberry Pi 01 & 02, BananaPi ?, Raspberry Pi 3 ?

2. E-ink HAT:

3. 3d printed case

4. Hardware clock

5. External power bank

6. UPS

7. Power bank HAT

8. Misc (Cables, HATs)

Example builds (I have tried)
