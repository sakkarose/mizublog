Made a lot of progress on blog



About my favorite song this month, this one really wrap up my nightly schedule this month. Since I have to go out a lot in order not to feed my seasonal affective thingy. As fast as I could but by the time I got home it's already dark so it didn't help as much as the recommendations I got. So all I do in this time is just restlessly walk around my block. Then get back to my relatively small apartment room but has a lot of empty space at the same time.
